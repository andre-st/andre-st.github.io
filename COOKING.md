| Purpose              | Product                        | Notes
|----------------------|--------------------------------|---------------------------------
| Brewer               | AeroPress Go                   | don't expect more than 0.5 bar without Joepresso addon (real Espresso demands 9 bars), rather "Espresso-style", "Aeropress-style coffee" and Americano, much cleaner than French Press
| Thermometer          | Weber 6740 Digital Pocket T.   | checks brewing water and drink temperatures
| Grinder              | OSSAT Manual Coffee G. 25-28 g | all metal inside and out except wooden knob, the chinese "Comandante" but 1/4 price; <br>full charge with beans fills ~15g or well-nigh 1 leveled scoop of AeroPress Go (11.5 g), <br> so you can dump it straight into AP<br>Grind size in clicks: 1 (finest) - 26 (mid-coarse) - 40 (coarse)
| Timer                | PC or Smartphone Clock         | `$ sleep 40` on the Linux command line, or counting up: ```function timer() { for i in `seq 1 $1` ; do echo -ne "\r$i " ; sleep 1 ; done }``` in your alias-file
| Kettle               | no-name, could be anything     | the expensive ones (e.g. Fellow for 170 Euros) keep the set temperature and offer a gooseneck; I just pour the boiling water up into another mug (see below) and check temp.
| Weighing             | Soehnle Page Compact 100       | 'Tare' to reset to 0 after every step, 1 l water &thickapprox; 1 kg 
| Dishware             | Anpro Milk Pitcher 350 ml      | for easier (temp) measuring and pouring out water (not milk)
| Dishware             | AeroPress Go Mug               | receiving container when pressing the AeroPress, was sold with the AP Go
| Dishware             | Lambda Cappuccino cups 160ml   | smaller cups &ne; less coffee (drink 2 cups); more conscious sipping over mindless shotting with BigMac supersize cups just for coffeine



### Extraction:

| Extraction       | Taste
|------------------|------------------------------------
| under            | sour, lacking sweet, salty, quick finish
| ideal            | sweet, ripe, transparent (clarity/less distractions), complex acidity, finishhhhhhhh
| over             | bitter, dry astringent (black tea), hollow, empty


| Roast  | Alt. Name                                  | Brew-Water Temp.  | Grind                      | Taste / Mouthfeel
|--------|--------------------------------------------|-------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------
| dark   | Vienna/French/Italian Roast, Full City R.  | 80-85&deg;C       | mid-to-coarse              | less sour (acids away), more bitter, more body (weight more milky than watery, creamy to chewy, not like tea), shocolade/nut notes ("sugar browing"), body preferred for espresso
| medium | American Roast, City Roast                 | 92&deg;C          | mid-grind                  | sweeter than light roast, good body, light sour notes
| light  | Cinnamom Roast, New England Roast          | 92&deg;-boiling   | mid-to-fine grind (lil coarser than very fine Espresso) | fruity/original or natural notes, more acids, preferred for filter coffee


Other:
- amount of coffeine depends on the brewing method (the longer the more coffeine) and roast (the darker the less)
- Aeropress inverted method avoids messing up the extraction by having a bunch of water drip through filter too early



### Test Series:

I usually:
- prefer soft water
- use 2 filters (not rinsed with hot water anymore, although said to prevent "paper taste" and help sticking in the filter cap)
- level the coffee bed in the Aeropress (shake it etc)
- serve at 60&deg;C
- drink black coffee (no milk, no suggar)
